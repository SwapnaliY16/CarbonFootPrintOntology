One of the main problems we are currently and will be facing in the future is climate change. Many people try to live more sustainably so that our daily decisions don't harm the environment. One aspect of sustainability that receives a lot of attention is food, particularly the effects of what we eat and how we may make decisions that don't harm the environment.
How can the environmental impact of food production be properly modelled in a way that is helpful to customers, food producers, and other people concerned about sustainability? An ontology that utilises CO2 emissions from the various phases of food manufacturing and distribution as a barometer for environmental effect, viable alternatives, and how the CO2 emissions measure up is required to solve this.
